# Network Anamoly Prediction-sem6
While a network administrator may be able to see and check the record of different IPs and PORTS, it may not be feasible for the administrator to go through all the logs and determine whether a behaviour is suspicious or not, Hence we propose a solution to classify whether an activity over a network is an anomaly or not. <br><br>
Algorithms used for classification: <br>
1. XgBoost Classifier Algorithm
2. GaussianNB
3. KNeighborsClassifier
4. RandomForestClassifier
5. AdaBoostClassifier
6. GradientBoostingClassifier
7. MLPClassifier
8. DecisionTreeClassifier <br>
